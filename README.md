# Parapet

`Parapet` sits above your data application the way a general stands at the parapet — with a commanding view of the entire landscape. It adds a natural language AI interface to scenario-driven modelling applications, letting non-technical users ask questions, run scenarios, and interpret results without leaving their workflow.

Provider-agnostic by design, Parapet works with Claude, Azure OpenAI, Copilot, or any LLM your organisation uses.
